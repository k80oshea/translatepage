Based on a system that translates between (currently) two languages when rendering to a webpage.

Any user can switch between languages to chosen language view. Admin users can enter new text and corresponding translation, or edit existing text and corresponding translation.

Admin users can also add new staff members to use the site (either at regular staff level or admin level). Regular staff do not have the ability to edit or add text/translations.
